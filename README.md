# Notes---Post-Exploitation
- First task is to gather additional information about the system, including users, permissions, installed applications, how software is configured, and other things about the system which will help us in our quest for root.
## Privilege Escalation
- Different types of information we will gather :
```bash
- System and Network Information
- User Information
- Privileged Access / Cleartext Credentials
- Services
- Jobs/Tasks
- Installed Software Version Information
```

#### System and Network Information
- Hostname --> command : `hostname`
- Kernel Version --> comamnd : `uname -a`
- Operating System :
```bash
Does our current OS have any known exploitable vulnerabilities?

cat /etc/issue
```
- IP address --> command : `ifconfig`
- Running Process --> command : `ps auxw`
- Network Routes:
```bash
Is our currently compromised machine routed to other networks? Can we use this information to pivot?

route -n
```
- DNS Server:
```bash
Can we obtain information from the DNS server? Active Directory Accounts, Zone Transfers, etc.

cat /etc/resolv.conf
```
- ARP cache:
```bash
Have other machines communicated with another target? Are the other machines accessible from the target?

arp -a
```
- Current Network Connections:
```bash
Are there any established connections from our machine to other machines and vice versa? Are the connections over encrypted or non-encrypted channels? Can we sniff the traffic of those connections?

netstat -auntp
```
